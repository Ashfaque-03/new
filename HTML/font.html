            The word <strong><i>font</i></strong>refers to a set of printable or displayable typography or text characters in a specific style and size.
            <br>Font styles are used in both print and digital text.While typographic <b><i>font style</i></b>  have custom spacing and design, once
            <br>determined, this style will apply to both lowercase and uppercase letters as well as punctuation marks.The type design 
            <br>for a set of fonts is the typeface, and variations of this design form the <b>font family</b>.For example, Helvetica is a font
            <br> family, while Helvetica italic is a typeface, and Helvetica italic 10-point is a font. In practice,<i>font</i> and typeface 
            <br>are often used as synonyms even though they represent slightly different aspects of a specific font.

            In a trademark application for a word mark, you are essentially seeking registration of the wording (or lettering) without 
            regard to its style, design, font or any graphic features. In other words, you are protecting the wording, and not the logo.
            <mark> marking yellow colour over certain words</mark>Similar to a trademark, a service mark identifies and distinguishes the
            source of a service rather than a product, and the term trademark is often used to refer to both trademarks and service marks.
            Using a trademark prevents others from using a company or individual's products or services without their permission.
